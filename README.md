# JavaScript fiddles

Several fiddles to test and play with JavaScript. So to say my personal playground shared to the world to let others
learn and as well play with JavaScript.

I try to keep the different fiddles organized in folders.
In most cases each folder contains a html file which serves as the "visualisation" of the linked .js file. When a layout
is required there will be a .css file as well.

When a fiddle has more than one implementation there will be a .html, .js and .css for each one of them.
To avoid duplicate code or style declarations the similar parts are extracted to a single file in each folder.
