# Quicksort in steps

This performs and visualises the Quick sort.
Two versions of this visualisation exist.

- [All steps on a single page to scroll](without-bar.html) (as well on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/mulithemuli/pen/BayoeMR?editors=1010))
- [Every step selectable via slider](with-bar.html) (as well on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/mulithemuli/pen/eYmJNPL?editors=1010))

Each of the version has a JavaScript function at the top of the file, `startIt()` where the input array can be configured.

Code is baded on [https://www.guru99.com/quicksort-in-javascript.html](https://www.guru99.com/quicksort-in-javascript.html).

## Trivia

Got inspired to do this by [Quick-sort with Hungarian (Küküllőmenti legényes) folk dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywWBy6J5gz8).
